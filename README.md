#Given a frozen version of the bluesky db I have, create a db/dictionary on the cluster that maps from arxiv ID -> [bluesky posts about the ID]
#One approach in Python. The idea is to load frozen Bluesky database, iterate over its posts, extract any arXiv IDs from each postâ€™s text (using a regex that covers common arXiv ID formats), and then build a dictionary mapping each arXiv ID to a list of posts that mention it. Finally, Export this mapping to JSON file.
